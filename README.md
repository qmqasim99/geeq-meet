# Geeq Meet App

## Introduction

Geeq Meet is an app that takes the hassle out of getting together.

Discover a new restaurant, find a cafe for a work meeting or just minimize everyoneâ€™s journey to the park!

Geeq Meet allows you to join your friend list, chat about whatever you want and choose meeting point for all the group members.

Geeq Meet has the unique function of choosing a destination based on the type of place, which has equi-distance for each user. So each user will travel the same distance to a meeting point (e.g in the middle).

This uses an algorithm which takes the current-user latitude and longitude coordinates to calculate the global average position between everyone.

This App is developed using Expo React Native, Firebase and Google Map API.
